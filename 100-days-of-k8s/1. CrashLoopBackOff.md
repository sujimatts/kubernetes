CrashLoopBackOff is a common Kubernetes error which indicates a pod that is constantly crashing in an endless loop.

Common Causes:
1, Insufficient resources
2, Issues with init-container setup
3, Misconfigurations
4, Deploying failed services / apps
5, Locked file / database
6, Unable to load the config file
7, Connection issues
8, Failed references

Troubleshooting:
1. Check for “Back Off Restarting Failed Container”
 cmd-> Run kubectl describe pod [name].

2. Search the Logs From Previous Container Instance
 cmd-> kubectl logs --previous --tail 10

3. Check kubectl Deployment Logs
 cmd-> kubectl logs -f deploy/ -n

4. Access the CrashLoop container to identify the issue
Step 1: Locate the entrypoint and cmd for the container image
 cmd-> docker pull [image-id] to pull the image.
 cmd-> docker inspect [image-id]

Step 2: Change entrypoint
Since the container has crashed and couldn't start, we need to temporarily change the entrypoint to tail -f /dev/null.

Step 3: Install debugging tools (e.g. curl or vim) if its not there already
 cmd-> sudo apt-get install [name of debugging tool]


Step 4: Check for missing packages or dependencies
Step 5: Check application configuration
e.g. Inspecting environment variables and the credentials of the database configuration file.
